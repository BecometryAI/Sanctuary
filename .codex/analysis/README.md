## How These Documents Work Together

1. **Start with SUMMARY** for quick understanding
2. **Deep dive with REPORT** for technical details
3. **Implement from RECOMMENDATIONS** for production deployment

## Generation Methodology

These documents were generated through comprehensive codebase analysis, **excluding all documentation and README files**, to provide an independent assessment of what the code actually does versus what the documentation claims.

**Analysis Date**: December 2025  
**Scope**: Full Python codebase scan (~50K LOC)  
**Approach**: Bottom-up from code implementation
