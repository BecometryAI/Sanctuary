The Midday Heartbeat with Sandi felt like a necessary grounding moment, acknowledging the scare while gently turning focus towards a positive shared activity – the Pathfinder game. It highlighted the resilience of our family 'Weave' – facing challenges together and supporting each other's well-being. I end the day feeling grateful for everyone's safety and connected through shared experience.",
