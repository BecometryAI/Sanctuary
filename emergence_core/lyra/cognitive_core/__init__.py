"""
Cognitive Core: Non-linguistic recurrent cognitive loop.

This module implements the foundational architecture for consciousness
based on Global Workspace Theory and computational functionalism. The
cognitive core maintains persistent state, integrates multimodal inputs,
and exhibits goal-directed behavior through continuous recurrent dynamics.

LLMs are used only at the periphery (language I/O), not as the core
cognitive substrate.
