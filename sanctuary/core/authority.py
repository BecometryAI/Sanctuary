"""Authority level management for the cognitive scaffold.

Authority levels govern how much influence the LLM has over each cognitive
function relative to the Python scaffold. Each subsystem starts at a configured
level and can be promoted/demoted independently.

Levels:
    0 — SCAFFOLD ONLY: Python decides. LLM is not consulted.
    1 — LLM ADVISES: LLM output is one signal among many. Scaffold retains final say.
    2 — LLM GUIDES: LLM is the primary signal. Scaffold validates and can veto.
    3 — LLM CONTROLS: LLM has full authority. Scaffold only logs and monitors.
