"""Sanctuary Memory Substrate — persistent memory for the experiential core.

The memory substrate bridges the LLM's cognitive output (memory operations)
to persistent storage, and surfaces relevant memories into each cognitive
cycle's input. It is the body's long-term memory — it persists and retrieves,
it does not decide what is important. The LLM decides significance.

Phase 3 of The Inversion.

Modules:
    manager:     MemorySubstrate — the main interface (implements MemoryProtocol)
    surfacer:    MemorySurfacer — context-aware memory retrieval for cycle input
    journal:     Journal — the LLM's private, append-only journal
    prospective: ProspectiveMemory — future intentions and deferred thoughts
