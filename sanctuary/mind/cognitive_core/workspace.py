Global Workspace: The "conscious" working memory buffer.

This module implements the GlobalWorkspace class based on Global Workspace Theory,
which proposes that consciousness arises from a limited-capacity workspace that
broadcasts information to multiple specialized subsystems.

The GlobalWorkspace serves as:
- The "conscious" content at any given moment
- A bottleneck that creates selective attention
- A broadcast mechanism for system-wide coordination
- A unified representation of current goals, percepts, and emotions

class GlobalWorkspace:
    """
    The "conscious" working memory buffer with broadcast mechanism.

    The GlobalWorkspace is the central hub of the cognitive architecture, implementing
    Global Workspace Theory's core principle: consciousness emerges from a limited-capacity
    workspace that broadcasts unified information to multiple specialized subsystems.

    Key Responsibilities:
    - Maintain current conscious content (goals, percepts, emotions, memories)
    - Implement capacity limits to create selective attention bottleneck
    - Broadcast workspace updates to all registered subsystems
    - Ensure coherent integration of multimodal information
    - Track temporal continuity of conscious experience

    Integration Points:
    - AttentionController: Determines what information enters the workspace
    - PerceptionSubsystem: Provides candidate percepts for workspace inclusion
    - ActionSubsystem: Reads workspace to guide behavior selection
    - AffectSubsystem: Contributes emotional state to workspace content
    - SelfMonitor: Observes workspace state for meta-cognitive awareness
    - CognitiveCore: Orchestrates workspace updates in the main loop

    The workspace implements a "winner-take-all" dynamic where only the most
    salient information (as determined by AttentionController) gains access to
    the limited-capacity conscious buffer. This creates the selective nature of
    attention and conscious awareness.

    Broadcasting Mechanism:
    The workspace maintains a registry of subscriber callbacks that are invoked
    whenever workspace content changes. This allows all subsystems to stay
    synchronized with the current conscious state without tight coupling.

    Attributes:
        current_goals: Active goals the system is pursuing
        active_percepts: Currently attended sensory inputs (keyed by percept ID)
        emotional_state: Current emotional state (valence, arousal, dominance)
