"""Scaffold goal integrator — tracks goals and integrates LLM proposals.

The LLM proposes goal changes (add, complete, reprioritize, abandon).
The scaffold integrates these proposals based on authority level, maintains
the active goal list, and tracks basic dynamics (staleness).

Goal status is reported back to the LLM via ScaffoldSignals.
